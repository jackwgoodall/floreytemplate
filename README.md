This is an Rmarkdown package for members of the Florey Institute (and anyone else for whom it would be helpful) share early data with each other and with collaborators.  
The tutorial linked to this can be found at https://jackwgoodall.github.io/florey-markdown/
To install this package: 
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jackwgoodall/floreytemplate")

You can then open a new R markdown document, select 'From Template' then select 'Florey Template' and you're good to go!
