# Florey R Markdown Template and Tutorial

This is an Rmarkdown package for members of Sheffield's Florey Institute (and anyone else for whom it would be helpful) share early data with each other and with collaborators.  
The tutorial linked to this can be found at [[jackwgoodall/florey-markdown](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316f4386-1b1c-4ad9-89ad-ec53b1e07475)](https://jackwgoodall.github.io/floreytemplate/)

To install this package: 
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jackwgoodall/floreytemplate")

You can then open a new R markdown document, select 'From Template' then select 'Florey Template' and you're good to go!

Please open an issue or email me (j.goodall@sheffield.ac.uk) with any issues or suggestions for improvements.
